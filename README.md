A simple CRUD REST API service made in Go as a test assignment for a company coincidentally named Simpler.
Backed by Postgres, has a Redis cache layer, packed in Docker. 
Has a naive error logging middleware handler (naive, but handy, when i first tested service manually with curl, before i diligently covered it with tests here and there)
